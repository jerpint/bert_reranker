An example to confirm this occurred in April 1991 , when a very powerful tornado struck the town of Andover , Kansas . When the town was hit , eighty - four homes and fourteen businesses were destroyed by the tornado , but with no fatalities and only minor injuries . After the tornado hit Andover , it swept through a mobile home park consisting of 223 trailers . The park did have a tornado shelter , to which over 200 residents fled and survived without injuries .

There are various stimuli responsible for this phenomenon , the most prominent being response to changes in light intensity , though evidence suggests that biological clock s are an underlying stimulus as well . There are a number of potential reasons to explain the phenomenon in nature , though it is most typically to access food and avoid predators . While this mass migration is typically nocturnal , with the animals ascending from the depths at nightfall and descending at sunrise , novel types of vertical migration can occur in response to the different cues and stimuli that trigger migration .

By collaborating with biologists from Scripps Institution and the UCDWR , they were able to confirm that the observed reverberations from the echo - sounder were in fact related to the diel vertical migration of marine animals .

These vertical migrations often occur over large vertical distances , and are undertaken with the assistance of a swim bladder . The swim bladder is inflated when the fish wants to move up , and , given the high pressures in the mesoplegic zone , this requires significant energy . As the fish ascends , the pressure in the swimbladder must adjust to prevent it from bursting . When the fish wants to return to the depths , the swimbladder is deflated . Some mesopelagic fishes make daily migrations through the thermocline , where the temperature changes between 10 and 20 ° C , thus displaying considerable tolerance for temperature change . </P>","<P> The pelagic zone contains macro - and microfauna and myriad zooplankton which drift with the currents .

Some marine creatures make large migrations , either to other regions of the ocean on a seasonal basis or up and down its vertical layers , often ascending to feed at night before descending to safety by day . Ships can introduce or spread invasive species through the discharge of ballast water or through the transport of organisms that have accumulated as part of the fouling community on the hulls of vessels . </P>"]}

This implies that organizations , IT systems and procedures should not demand excessive amounts of personal information or credentials for identification and authentication . Requiring , storing and processing personal identifiers ( such as Social Security number , national identification number , driver 's license number , credit card number , etc . ) increases the risks of identity theft unless this valuable personal information is adequately secured at all times . Committing personal identifiers to memory is a sound practice that can reduce the risks of a would - be identity thief from obtaining these records . To help in remembering numbers such as social security numbers and credit card numbers , it is helpful to consider using mnemonic techniques or memory aids such as the mnemonic Major System . </P>","<P> Determining the link between data breaches and identity theft is challenging , primarily because identity theft victims often do not know how their personal information was obtained , and identity theft is not always detectable by the individual victims , according to a report done for the FTC . Identity fraud is often but not necessarily the consequence of identity theft . Someone can steal or misappropriate personal information without then committing identity theft using the information about every person , such as when a major data breach occurs . A US Government Accountability Office study determined that `` most breaches have not resulted in detected incidents of identity theft '' . The report also warned that `` the full extent is unknown '' . A later unpublished study by Carnegie Mellon University noted that `` Most often , the causes of identity theft is not known '' , but reported that someone else concluded that `` the probability of becoming a victim to identity theft as a result of a data breach is ... around only 2 % '' .

Some of the most common threats today are software attacks , theft of intellectual property , identity theft , theft of equipment or information , sabotage , and information extortion . Most people have experienced software attacks of some sort . Viruses , worms , phishing attacks , and Trojan horses are a few common examples of software attacks . The theft of intellectual property has also been an extensive issue for many businesses in the IT field . Identity theft is the attempt to act as someone else usually to obtain that person 's personal information or to take advantage of their access to vital information . Theft of equipment or information is becoming more prevalent today due to the fact that most devices today are mobile , are prone to theft and have also become far more desirable as the amount of data capacity increases . Sabotage usually consists of the destruction of an organization ′ s website in an attempt to cause loss of confidence on the part of its customers . Information extortion consists of theft of a company ′ s property or information as an attempt to receive a payment in exchange for returning the information or property back to its owner , as with ransomware . There are many ways to help protect yourself from some of these attacks but one of the most functional precautions is user carefulness . </P>","<P> Philippines , which ranks eighth in the numbers of users of Facebook and other social networking sites such as Twitter , Multiply and Tumblr , has been known as source of various identity theft problems .

( Zion is defined as `` the pure in heart '' and this city of Zion will return to the earth at the Second Coming of Jesus Christ . ) The Doctrine and Covenants further states that Enoch prophesied that one of his descendants , Noah , and his family , would survive a Great Flood and thus carry on the human race and preserve the Scripture . The Book of Moses in the Pearl of Great Price has several chapters that give an account of Enoch 's preaching , visions and conversations with God .

If Mt . Rainier were to erupt as powerfully as Mount St. Helens did in its May 18 , 1980 eruption , the effect would be cumulatively greater , because of the far more massive amounts of glacial ice locked on the volcano compared to Mount St. Helens , the vastly more heavily populated areas surrounding Rainier , and the simple fact that Mt Rainier is a much bigger volcano , almost twice the size of St. Helens . Lahars from Rainier pose the most risk to life and property , as many communities lie atop older lahar deposits . According to the United States Geological Survey ( USGS ) , about 150,000 people live on top of old lahar deposits of Rainier . Not only is there much ice atop the volcano , the volcano is also slowly being weakened by hydrothermal activity . According to Geoff Clayton , a geologist with a Washington State Geology firm , RH2 Engineering , a repeat of the Osceola mudflow would destroy Enumclaw , Orting , Kent , Auburn , Puyallup , Sumner and all of Renton . Such a mudflow might also reach down the Duwamish estuary and destroy parts of downtown Seattle , and cause tsunamis in Puget Sound and Lake Washington .

Geologists were also concerned that the St. Helens eruption was a sign that long - dormant Cascade volcanoes might become active once more , as in the period from 1800 to 1857 when a total of eight erupted . None have erupted since St. Helens , but precautions are being taken nevertheless , such as the Mount Rainier Volcano Lahar Warning System in Pierce County , Washington . </P>"]}

Piston type steam engines played a central role to the Industrial Revolution and modern steam turbines are used to generate more than 80 % of the world 's electricity . If liquid water comes in contact with a very hot surface or depressurizes quickly below its vapor pressure , it can create a steam explosion . </P>","<P> Dry steam stations are the simplest and oldest design . This type of power station is not found very often but is the most efficient . There are little emissions produced and have a simpler design to them . In these sites no water is produced but instead only the steam from that water . Dry Steam Power directly uses geothermal steam of 150 ° C or greater to turn turbines . As the turbine rotates it powers a generator which then produces electricity and adds to the power field . Then , the steam is emitted to a condenser . Here the steam turns back into a liquid which then cools the water . After the water is cooled it flows down a pipe that emerges back into the soil . </P>","<P> Cooling towers originated in the 19th century through the development of condensers for use with the steam engine . Condensers use relatively cool water , via various means , to condense the steam coming out of the cylinders or turbines . This reduces the back pressure , which in turn reduces the steam consumption , and thus the fuel consumption , while at the same time increasing power and recycling boiler - water . However the condensers require an ample supply of cooling water , without which they are impractical . The consumption of cooling water by inland processing and power plants is estimated to reduce power availability for the majority of thermal power plants by 2040 -- 2069 . While water usage is not an issue with marine engines , it forms a significant limitation for many land - based systems . </P>","<P> The flow exceeded the allowed limit at 01 : 19 , triggering an alarm of low steam pressure in the steam separators . At the same time , the extra water flow lowered the overall core temperature and reduced the existing steam voids in the core and the steam separators . Since water weakly absorbs neutrons ( and the higher density of liquid water makes it a better absorber than steam ) , turning on additional pumps decreased the reactor power further still . The crew responded by turning off two of the circulation pumps to reduce feedwater flow , in an effort to increase steam pressure , and also to remove more manual control rods to maintain power . </P>","<P> Steam engines and steam turbines use the expansion of steam to drive a piston or turbine to perform mechanical work . The ability to return condensed steam as water - liquid to the boiler at high pressure with relatively little expenditure of pumping power is important . Condensation of steam to water often occurs at the low - pressure end of a steam turbine , since this maximizes the energy efficiency , but such wet - steam conditions must be limited to avoid excessive turbine blade erosion . Engineers use an idealised thermodynamic cycle , the Rankine cycle , to model the behavior of steam engines . Steam turbines are often used in the production of electricity . </P>"]}

In particular , polyphony consists of two or more simultaneous lines of independent melody , as opposed to a musical texture with just one voice , monophony , or a texture with one dominant melodic voice accompanied by chords , which is called homophony . </P>","<P> Since polyphonic textures with interweaving melodic lines were no longer the main focus of music ( excluding in the development section ) , a single melodic line with accompaniment became the main texture . In the Classical era , there was greater emphasis on notating that line for dynamics and phrasing . This contrasts with the Baroque era , when melodies were typically written with no dynamics , phrasing marks or ornaments , as it was assumed that the performer would improvise these elements on the spot . In the Classical era , it became more common for composers to indicate where they wanted performers to play ornaments such as trills or turns . The simplification of texture made such instrumental detail more important , and also made the use of characteristic rhythms , such as attention - getting opening fanfares , the funeral march rhythm , or the minuet genre , more important in establishing and unifying the tone of a single movement . </P>","<P> In music , texture is how the melodic , rhythmic , and harmonic materials are combined in a composition , thus determining the overall quality of the sound in a piece . Texture is often described in regard to the density , or thickness , and range , or width , between lowest and highest pitches , in relative terms as well as more specifically distinguished according to the number of voices , or parts , and the relationship between these voices . For example , a thick texture contains many `` layers '' of instruments . One of these layers could be a string section , or another brass . </P>","<P> Blues music also adopted elements from the `` Ethiopian airs '' , minstrel shows and Negro spirituals , including instrumental and harmonic accompaniment . The style also was closely related to ragtime , which developed at about the same time , though the blues better preserved `` the original melodic patterns of African music '' . </P>","<P> Chopin 's harmonic innovations may have arisen partly from his keyboard improvisation technique . Temperley says that in his works `` novel harmonic effects frequently result from the combination of ordinary appoggiaturas or passing notes with melodic figures of accompaniment '' , and cadences are delayed by the use of chords outside the home key ( neapolitan sixths and diminished sevenths ) , or by sudden shifts to remote keys . Chord progressions sometimes anticipate the shifting tonality of later composers such as Claude Debussy , as does Chopin 's use of modal harmony . </P>"]}

Cal Poly 's office of public affairs recommends not to abbreviate the university 's name merely as `` Cal Poly '' .

Kellogg Institute of Animal Husbandry University of California , Pomona '' , came into use to describe the site . Although Cal Poly Pomona is now part of the California State University , its naming convention does not follow that of most campuses within the system ( for example , the CSU campus in San Diego bears the full official name `` San Diego State University '' and the CSU campus in Fullerton uses the name `` California State University , Fullerton '' ) .

'' </P>","<P> The UC system follows a consistent style in the naming of campuses , using the words `` University of California '' followed by the name of its declared home city , with a comma as the separator . Most CSU campuses follow a similar pattern , though several are named only for their home city or county , such as San Francisco State University , San Jose State University , San Diego State University , or Sonoma State University . Some of the colleges follow neither pattern . California Polytechnic State University , San Luis Obispo and California State Polytechnic University , Pomona use the word `` polytechnic '' in both their full names ( but in different word orders ) . They also use the abbreviated forms `` Cal Poly San Luis Obispo '' and `` Cal Poly Pomona '' respectively , and the San Luis Obispo campus brands its athletic program as `` Cal Poly '' with no city . In addition , the California Maritime Academy ( Cal Maritime ) is the only campus whose official name does not refer to its location in California . Both Channel Islands and San Marcos campuses ' official names do not include a comma , unlike the typical style of the CSU naming convention , and instead follow California State University San Marcos , or Channel Islands . Some critics , including Donald Gerth ( former President of Sacramento State ) , have claimed that the weak California State University identity has contributed to the CSU 's perceived lack of prestige when compared to the University of California . </P>"]}

Since the adoption of the Twenty - fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution ( February 10 , 1967 ) , when there is a vacancy in the office of the Vice President , the President nominates a successor who takes office upon confirmation by a majority vote of both Houses of Congress . </P>","<P> Harrison 's cabinet insisted that Tyler was `` Vice President acting as President '' . After the cabinet consulted with the Chief Justice Roger Taney , they decided that if Tyler took the presidential Oath of Office , he would assume the office of president . Tyler obliged and was sworn into office on April 6 , 1841 . Congress convened in May , and after a short period of debate in both houses , it passed a resolution that confirmed Tyler as president for the remainder of Harrison 's term . Once established , this precedent of presidential succession remained in effect until the Twenty - fifth Amendment was ratified in 1967 , following the assassination of John F. Kennedy and the succession of Lyndon B. Johnson to the presidency in 1963 . The Twenty - fifth Amendment dealt with the finer points of succession , defining the situations in which the vice president would serve as acting president , and in which situations the vice president could become president . </P>","<P> The words president elect appear four times in the Constitution , and they did n't appear until 1933 , when the Twentieth Amendment , which contained a provision addressing the unavailability of the president elect to take the oath of office on Inauguration Day , was ratified . Section 3 provides that if there is no president - elect on January 20 , or the president - elect `` fails to qualify '' , the vice president - elect would become acting president on January 20 until there is a qualified president . The section also provides that if the president - elect dies before noon on January 20 , the vice president - elect becomes president . In cases where there is no president - elect or vice president - elect , the amendment also gives the Congress the authority to declare an acting president until such time as there is a president or vice president . At this point the Presidential Succession Act of 1947 would apply , with the office of the Presidency going to the speaker of the House of Representatives , followed by the president pro tempore of the Senate and various Cabinet officers . </P>","<P> The 25th Amendment explicitly states that if the President dies , resigns or is removed from office , the Vice President becomes President , and also establishes a procedure for filling a vacancy in the office of the Vice President . It supersedes the ambiguous wording of this clause . The Amendment further provides that the President , or the Vice President and Cabinet , can declare the President unable to discharge his duties , in which case the Vice President becomes Acting President . If the declaration is done by the Vice President and Cabinet , the Amendment permits the President to take control back , unless the Vice President and Cabinet challenge the President and two - thirds of both Houses vote to sustain the findings of the Vice President and Cabinet . If the declaration is done by the President , he may take control back without risk of being overridden by the Congress . </P>","<P> Section 3 provides that if the president - elect dies before Inauguration Day , the vice president - elect will be sworn in as president on that day . If there is no president - elect , or the president - elect fails to meet all of the Constitution 's qualifications to be president , Section 3 provides that the vice president - elect would become acting president on Inauguration Day until there is a president who does qualify . Section 3 also allows Congress to determine who should be acting president if a new president and vice president have not been chosen by Inauguration Day . The Constitution was originally silent on this point , an omission that nearly caused a constitutional crisis when Congress seemed deadlocked in resolving the election of 1800 . </P>"]}

The office ultimately learns of their relationship in `` Dunder Mifflin Infinity '' . In `` Chair Model '' , after teasing Pam about his impending proposal , Jim tells the documentary crew he is not kidding around about an engagement and shows them a ring he bought a week after he and Pam started dating . In the next few episodes , Jim fake - proposes to Pam multiple times . In `` Goodbye , Toby '' , Pam discovers she 's been accepted at Pratt Institute , an art and design school in Brooklyn . In an interview later in the episode , Jim announces that he will propose to Pam that evening . Just as Jim is preparing to propose , however , Andy Bernard stands up and makes his own impromptu proposal to Angela . Having had his thunder stolen by Andy , Jim reluctantly puts the ring back in his jacket pocket , leaving Pam visibly disappointed as she was expecting Jim to propose that night . </P>","<P> New salesman Danny Cordray ( Timothy Olyphant ) invites everyone to a Halloween party at his bar after work . Almost everyone in the office is aware that Danny and Pam had a two - date fling four years ago . Kevin Malone ( Brian Baumgartner ) and Andy Bernard ( Ed Helms ) tell Danny that they are not going to his party because Pam does not want them to , which incites Danny to confront Jim and Pam . They reassure him that Pam does not care if people go to his party , and the three laugh about how their coworkers have been exaggerating the significance of his two dates with Pam ; however , it also becomes clear that Pam wants to know exactly why she was rejected . Danny initially tells Jim that Pam wrote her number weird . Jim calls him on this , and Danny said he never called back because Pam talked about Jim during their dates . Pam reveals she never mentioned Jim , and so Danny admits that he found her too `` dorky . '' Jim realizes he loves Pam for being so dorky , and comes into the office wearing his Popeye costume and carrying CeCe ( dressed as Swee'Pea ) , much to the delight of Pam . </P>","<P> Michael does n't hesitate to compliment or criticize Pam for her looks and he frequently mentions her breasts . In the episode `` Diwali '' Michael mistakenly thinks that he and Pam have a connection , and is rejected when he tries to kiss her . Throughout their relationship , Pam has served as something of a shoulder angel for Michael by encouraging him to be more productive and discouraging his bad ideas , with varying degrees of success . She grows closer to Michael as he supports her goals in pursuing sales and art . Pam is visibly touched when , after many art show attendees dismiss her artwork , Michael is so impressed that he asks to buy her painting of their office building . Their relationship comes to a rocky point when he begins dating her mother Helene . This is only repaired after he breaks up with Helene and allows Pam to slap him in the face in the parking lot . He trusts and respects Jim , although when they were co-managers they clashed due to their polar - opposite management styles . In `` Secret Santa '' , Michael mentions that in a future vision he sees himself and his future wife living next door to Jim and Pam and that their children will play together . He often also refers to Jim as his best friend in the office , although , based on his impersonation of Jim using surfer slang in `` Michael 's Last Dundies '' , does not have a very good understanding of his personality . While Jim and Pam are both shown to care about Michael , his clingy nature makes them reluctant to socialize with him outside of the office ; such as when , after numerous unsuccessful invitations , Michael is forced to trick them in order to have them over for a disastrous dinner in the episode `` Dinner Party . '' In a Season 5 episode , Michael also shows his admiration for Jim , when Jim wears a tuxedo to work and goes on and on about having a ' classy party ' for the party planning committee , and frequently suggests all of the ideas Dwight had offered that Michael had then rejected , only to bother Dwight by having Michael accept the same ideas from him . During Cecilia Halpert 's baptism , Michael approaches Pam referring to himself as `` the godfather '' while imitating Don Corleone , after which she sympathetically but emphatically asks him to acknowledge that he wo n't be Cece 's godfather , he is disappointed but does so and is hurt to learn that the godparents are a couple they 'd only recently met . Pam is shown to have a soft spot for Michael , such as when she consoles him after he finds Holly to be in a relationship with AJ , and when she advises him on how to propose to Holly . In `` Goodbye , Michael '' it is revealed that Michael is secretly planning to leave for Colorado at the end of his penultimate work day , thereby avoiding having to say goodbye to everyone . Jim figures this out and goes along with it , telling Michael that he will tell him what a great boss he was the following day at lunch , which they both know Michael will not be around for ; Michael and Jim both get sentimental during this final conversation between them . The strength of his relationship with Pam is revealed as he continuously asks about her whereabouts , not wanting to leave without saying goodbye . Pam , who spent the better part of the day away from the office , finds Michael at the airport and says goodbye in a touching scene just as he 's about to board his plane for Colorado . She watches from the window as his plane flies off . In a deleted scene of `` The Inner Circle '' , Pam is flattered that Michael named his new dog `` Pamela Beagsley . '' Pam later teases Jim that their second child will be named `` little Michael Scott '' displaying the friendship she had developed with her former boss . </P>","<P> In `` Heavy Competition '' , Andy offers bargain deals on wedding plans to Pam and Jim . However , he mistakes Pam 's rejection of Jim 's ideas as Pam controlling him . Andy assumes the role as Jim 's emotional rock , which Jim goes along with , as a prank . When Andy makes an announcement to the office for them to respect Jim 's emotional needs , Phyllis informs him that Jim is just messing with him . When he goes to confront Jim over the matter , Jim tells Andy that he is very happy with Pam , and assures Andy that , while his breakup with Angela was `` A bummer '' , he will find someone else . </P>","<P> Pam Halpert ( Jenna Fischer ) trains a temporary worker Cathy Simms ( Lindsey Broad ) so that she can take her place when she goes on maternity leave . In the break room , the other workers discuss how attractive Cathy is and how excited they are to have her in the office . Pam , being well into her pregnancy , is sensitive about her looks and so becomes offended by their discussion . Most of them respond by assuring Pam that she is , if anything , more sexually attractive than before she was pregnant . Dwight Schrute ( Rainn Wilson ) , however , argues that sexual attractiveness is a mostly objective quality and pregnant women can not be sexually attractive , and accuses the others of lying to spare Pam 's feelings . Troubled by Dwight 's comments , Pam asks her husband Jim Halpert ( John Krasinski ) if he finds the new temp attractive . Not wanting to upset his wife , Jim tells her that he does not find her replacement attractive , even objectively . Though Jim gives no sign of unease , Pam is convinced that he is lying to her , and enlists the help of the harshly honest Dwight to prove it . After a number of unsuccessful attempts to trick Jim into revealing he finds Pam 's replacement attractive , Dwight and Pam convince Jim to submit to a lie detection test in the form of a retail store 's blood pressure tester . At the conclusion of the interview , Dwight triumphantly announces that he recorded hypertension when Jim said he does not find the new temp attractive , but as Jim continues to insist he is telling the truth Dwight admits that he recorded equal hypertension on every question , including Jim 's name . Pam realizes that Jim has unusually high blood pressure , which his father also suffers from , and forgets about the issue in order to focus on her husband 's health . </P>"]}

When Henderson asks Grandpa why he owed twenty - four years of back income tax , Grandpa states he never believed in it , and that the government would n't know what to do with the money if he did pay it . Henderson becomes infuriated by Grandpa 's answers to his questions .

Around half of the driving in Bullitt was performed by Loren Janes . </P>","<P> Although the Mustang has become famous for the car chase , outside of the chase it only appears three other times throughout the movie . The first is when Frank pulls up to the hospital to check on the injured Ross . The second when Frank is driving home after having the deceased Ross transferred to the city morgue . The third is when Frank parks near the car wash to talk with the cabbie , Weissberg . After riding with Weissberg to retrace Ross ' actions before checking into the hotel Bullitt is next seen in the Mustang , being tailed by the hitmen . The chase immediately follows . </P>","<P> Another of the memorable moments in Hickman 's career was when he was asked to perform a high - risk car - chase scene by William Friedkin for his 1971 film The French Connection . As with Bullitt , The French Connection ( also produced by Bullitt 's producer , Philip D'Antoni ) is famed for its car - chase sequence . What differs from the usual car chase is that Gene Hackman 's character is chasing an elevated train from the street below ( the scene was filmed in Bensonhurst , Brooklyn , with most of the action taking place on 86th Street ) . This chase was performed in real traffic , as Hickman drove the brown 1971 Pontiac LeMans at speeds up to 90 mph with Friedkin manning the camera right behind him , and at one point Hickman hits a car driven by a fellow stunt driver who missed his point ; this scene was kept in the film by Friedkin as it added reality to the whole sequence , however , the scene where the woman steps out into the street with a baby carriage was staged . Hickman also had a supporting role in the film as federal agent Mulderig . </P>"]}

Frey commented , `` We just wanted to allude to Steely Dan rather than mentioning them outright , so ' Dan ' got changed to ' knives , ' which is still , you know , a penile metaphor . '' .

In the song `` Glamour Profession '' the conclusion of a drug deal is celebrated with dumplings at Mr. Chow , a Chinese restaurant in Beverly Hills .

In a note released to the media , Donald Fagen remembered his longtime friend and band mate , and promised to `` keep the music we created together alive as long as I can with the Steely Dan band .

According to the 1881 Census , Andrew Kay employed 30 people in his curling stone factory in Mauchline . The last harvest of Ailsa Craig granite by Kays took place in 2013 , after a hiatus of 11 years ; 2,000 tons were harvested , sufficient to fill anticipated orders through at least 2020 . Kays have been involved in providing curling stones for the Winter Olympics since Chamonix in 1924 and has been the exclusive manufacturer of curling stones for the Olympics since the 2006 Winter Olympics . </P>","<P> Evidence that curling existed in Scotland in the early 16th century includes a curling stone inscribed with the date 1511 uncovered ( along with another bearing the date 1551 ) when an old pond was drained at Dunblane , Scotland . The world 's oldest curling stone and the world 's oldest football are now kept in the same museum ( the Stirling Smith Art Gallery and Museum ) in Stirling . The first written reference to a contest using stones on ice coming from the records of Paisley Abbey , Renfrewshire , in February 1541 . Two paintings , `` Winter Landscape with a Bird Trap '' and `` The Hunters in the Snow '' ( both dated 1565 ) by Pieter Bruegel the Elder depict Flemish peasants curling , albeit without brooms ; Scotland and the Low Countries had strong trading and cultural links during this period , which is also evident in the history of golf . </P>","<P> The word curling first appears in print in 1620 in Perth , Scotland , in the preface and the verses of a poem by Henry Adamson . The sport was ( and still is , in Scotland and Scottish - settled regions like southern New Zealand ) also known as `` the roaring game '' because of the sound the stones make while traveling over the pebble ( droplets of water applied to the playing surface ) . The verbal noun curling is formed from the Scots ( and English ) verb curl , which describes the motion of the stone . </P>","<P> From the mid-nineteenth century the island has been quarried for its rare type of micro-granite with riebeckite ( known as `` Ailsite '' ) , which is used to make stones for the sport of curling . As of 2004 , 60 -- 70 % of all curling stones in use were made from granite from the island and it is one of only two sources for all stones in the sport , the other being the Trefor Granite Quarry in Wales . </P>"]}

Cookies and Cream ice cream uses sweet cream ice cream ( often vanilla ) and chocolate wafer cookies of any type . The flavor is widely associated with the Oreo cookie , a kind of cookie sandwich with a sweet , white crème filling commonly used in milkshakes and other frozen desserts . </P>","<P> Ice cream is flavored by artificial or natural vanilla flavoring . Artificial flavorings contain 100 % vanillin , the main ingredient that contributes to natural vanilla extract 's flavor . Natural vanilla extract also contains nearly 200 more compounds in addition to vanillin . The different chemical properties of these compounds may cause compatibility issues with different ice cream preparations . Vanilla ice cream may be classified by the type of flavoring used . If natural vanilla extract is used , then the product is called `` vanilla ice - cream '' . If vanillin from natural vanilla is used , then the product is called `` vanilla flavored ice cream '' . If artificial vanillin is used , then the product is labelled as an `` artificially flavored vanilla ice - cream '' . The United States Food and Drug Administration characterizes vanilla ice cream into three categories . Category I ice cream only contains vanilla extract . Category II ice cream contains 1 ounce ( 28 g ) of synthetic vanilla per gallon ( 3.8 l ) of 1-fold vanilla extract . Category III only contains synthetic ingredients . </P>","<P> The original sundae consists of vanilla ice cream topped with a flavored sauce or syrup , whipped cream , and a maraschino cherry . Classic sundaes are typically named after flavored syrup employed in the recipe : cherry sundae , chocolate sundae , strawberry sundae , raspberry sundae , etc . The classic sundae is traditionally served in a tulip - shaped , footed glass vase . Due to the long association between the shape of the glass and the dessert , this style of serving dish is generally now known as a sundae glass . </P>","<P> From what I can find , the article contains an error . `` Neopolitan '' refers to Naples , Italy . There is no reason as far as I can tell to infer that it is called Neopolitan because it was `` Napoleon 's favorite ice cream '' . ( Which I had always assumed . ) In fact , multi-flavored ice cream ( `` spumoni '' ) blocks were popular around the early 1900 's . Italians and Sicilians ran many of the confectionary shops in the U.S and so the combination became known as `` Neopolitan '' in the U.S. Because chocolate , strawberry and vanilla were the most popular flavors in the U.S. they are the traditional combination . </P>","<P> `` These are prepared by putting ices of various kinds and colors into a mold known as a Neapolitan ice box , which , when set and turned out , is cut into slices suitable for serving . However small the pieces , the block should be cut so that each person gets some of each kind . They are generally laid on a lace paper on an ice plate . Four or five kinds are usually put in the mold , though three sorts will do . The following will serve as a guide in arranging : First , vanilla cream , then raspberry or cherry or currant water ; coffee or chocolate in the middle ; the strawberry cream , with lemon or orange or pineapple water to finish . A cream ice flavored with any liqueur , a brown bread cream flavored with brandy , with a couple of bright - colored water ices , form another agreeable mixture . Tea cream may be introduced into almost any combination unless coffee were used . Banana cream , pistachio , or almond cream with cherry water and damson or strawberry water are other options . </P>"]}

In addition to these three main types , Howard added two names to designate multiple cloud types joined together : cumulostratus , a blending of cumulus clouds and stratus layers , and nimbus , a complex blending of cirriform , cumuliform , and stratiform clouds with sufficient vertical development to produce significant precipitation . </P>","<P> `` Aureole '' , from the Latin for `` golden '' , has been used in English as a term for a gold crown , especially that traditionally considered the reward of martyrs , since the Middle Ages ( OED 1220 ) .

This , by what the OED calls a `` strange blunder '' , derived the word from the Latin `` aura '' as a diminutive , and also defined it as meaning a halo or glory covering the whole body , whilst saying that `` nimbus '' referred only to a halo around the head . This , according to the OED , reversed the historical usage of both words , but whilst Didron 's diktat was `` not accepted in France '' , the OED noted it had already been picked up by several English dictionaries , and influenced usage in English , which still seems to be the case , as the word `` nimbus '' is mostly found describing whole - body haloes , and seems to have also influenced `` gloriole '' in the same direction . </P>"]}

Dynasties such as the Han and Ming dynasties were founded by men of common origins . The concept is in some ways similar to the European concept of the divine right of kings ; however , unlike the European concept , it does not in theory confer an unconditional right to rule , despite this being exactly the case in practicality . The Mandate would in theory be a preoccupation in a ruler 's lifetime , when he would hold onto the Mandate and live according to Heavens . Intrinsic to the concept of the Mandate of Heaven was the right of rebellion against an unjust ruler . Chinese historians interpreted a successful revolt as evidence that Heaven had withdrawn its mandate from the ruler . Throughout Chinese history , times of poverty and natural disasters were often taken as signs that heaven considered the incumbent ruler unjust and thus in need of replacement . The Mandate of Heaven was often invoked by philosophers and scholars in China as a way to curtail the abuse of power by the ruler . While each dynasty was not the same , they each had a lineage that passed on the prospective ruler by order of generational descent or their priority of birth . Many emperors during the imperial times would optimize to have many sons who could be candidates to fill the position after the current ruler has died . In addition Heaven was thought to be of how a ruler 's works and performance was , which reflected upon how favorable they would be to Heaven . </P>"]}

One consequence was that it was considered a capital offense to harm a tribune , to disregard his veto , or to interfere with a tribune .

They won the right to stand for office , the abolition of the intermarriage law , and the creation of office of tribune of the plebs . This office , founded in 494 BC as a result of a plebeian secession , was the main legal bulwark against the powers of the patrician class , and only plebeians were eligible . The tribunes originally had the power to protect any plebeian from a patrician magistrate . Later revolts forced the Senate to grant the tribunes additional powers , such as the right to veto legislation . A tribune 's person was sacrosanct , and he was obliged to keep an open house at all times while in office . Some patricians , notably Clodius Pulcher in the late 60s BC , petitioned to be assigned plebeian status , in order to accumulate the political influence among the people that the office of tribune afforded . The conflict between the classes came to a climax in 287 BC when patricians and plebeians were declared equal under the law . </P>","<P> Plebeian tribunes were not officially `` magistrates '' , since they were elected only by the plebeians .

Baltimore , the Supreme Court of the United States held that the Bill of Rights did not apply to state governments ; such protections were instead provided by the constitutions of each state . After the Civil War , Congress and the states ratified the Fourteenth Amendment , which included the Due Process Clause and the Privileges or Immunities Clause . While the Fifth Amendment had included a due process clause , the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment crucially differed from the Fifth Amendment in that it explicitly applied to the states . The Privileges or Immunities Clause also explicitly applied to the states , unlike the Privileges and Immunities Clause of Article IV of the Constitution . In the Slaughter - House Cases ( 1873 ) , the Supreme Court ruled that the Privileges or Immunities Clause was not designed to protect individuals from the actions of state governments . In Twining v. New Jersey ( 1908 ) , the Supreme Court acknowledged that the Due Process Clause might incorporate some of the Bill of Rights , but continued to reject any incorporation under the Privileges or Immunities Clause . </P>","<P> Some have suggested that the Privileges or Immunities Clause would be a more appropriate textual basis than the due process clause for incorporation of the Bill of Rights . It is often said that the Slaughter - House Cases `` gutted the privileges or immunities clause '' and thus prevented its use for applying the Bill of Rights against the states . In his dissent to Adamson v. California , however , Justice Hugo Black pointed out that the Slaughter - House Cases did not directly involve any right enumerated in the Constitution : </P>","<P> The Privileges or Immunities Clause , which protects the privileges and immunities of national citizenship from interference by the states , was patterned after the Privileges and Immunities Clause of Article IV , which protects the privileges and immunities of state citizenship from interference by other states . In the Slaughter - House Cases ( 1873 ) , the Supreme Court concluded that the Constitution recognized two separate types of citizenship -- `` national citizenship '' and `` state citizenship '' -- and the Court held that the Privileges or Immunities Clause prohibits states from interfering only with privileges and immunities possessed by virtue of national citizenship . The Court concluded that the privileges and immunities of national citizenship included only those rights that `` owe their existence to the Federal government , its National character , its Constitution , or its laws . '' The Court recognized few such rights , including access to seaports and navigable waterways , the right to run for federal office , the protection of the federal government while on the high seas or in the jurisdiction of a foreign country , the right to travel to the seat of government , the right to peaceably assemble and petition the government , the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus , and the right to participate in the government 's administration . This decision has not been overruled and has been specifically reaffirmed several times . Largely as a result of the narrowness of the Slaughter - House opinion , this clause subsequently lay dormant for well over a century . </P>","<P> Unlike the Dormant Commerce Clause , there is no market participant exception to the Privileges and Immunities Clause . That means that even when a state is acting as a producer or supplier for a marketable good or service , the Privileges and Immunities Clause may prevent it from discriminating against non-residents . </P>","<P> The act of incorporation is on the people of the territory , not on the territory per se , by extending the privileges and immunities clause of the constitution to them . </P>"]}

This may be the result of introgression , although hybrids between the mule deer and white - tailed deer are rare in the wild ( apparently more common locally in West Texas ) , and the hybrid survival rate is low even in captivity . Many claims of observations of wild hybrids are not legitimate , as identification based on external features is complicated . </P>","<P> Several methods have been developed in attempts to curb the population of white - tailed deer and these can be separated into lethal and non-lethal strategies . Most common in the U.S is the use of extended hunting as population control . In Maryland , as well as many other states , a state agency sets regulations on bag limits and hunting in the area depending on the deer population levels assessed . Hunting seasons may fluctuate in duration , or restrictions may be set to affect how many deer or what type of deer can be hunted in certain regions . For the 2015 - 2016 white - tailed deer hunting season , some areas only allow for the hunting of antler-less white - tailed deer . These would include young bucks and females encouraging the culling of does who would otherwise contribute to increasing populations via offspring production . </P>","<P> The deer 's coat is a reddish - brown in the spring and summer and turns to a grey - brown throughout the fall and winter . The deer can be recognized by the characteristic white underside to its tail . It raises its tail when it is alarmed to warn the predator that it has been detected . A population of white - tailed deer in New York is entirely white ( except for areas like their noses and toes ) -- not albino -- in color . The former Seneca Army Depot in Romulus , New York , has the largest known concentration of white deer . Strong conservation efforts have allowed white deer to thrive within the confines of the depot . White - tailed deer 's horizontally slit pupils allow for good night vision and color vision during the day . </P>"]}

In Chapter 4 of the 5th edition of The Origin published in 1869 , Darwin implies again the synonym : `` Natural Selection , or the Survival of the Fittest '' . By the word `` fittest '' Darwin meant `` better adapted for immediate , local environment '' , not the common modern meaning of `` in the best physical shape '' ( think of a puzzle piece , not an athlete ) . In the introduction he gave full credit to Spencer , writing `` I have called this principle , by which each slight variation , if useful , is preserved , by the term Natural Selection , in order to mark its relation to man 's power of selection . But the expression often used by Mr. Herbert Spencer of the Survival of the Fittest is more accurate , and is sometimes equally convenient . '' </P>","<P> However , the expression `` survival of the fittest '' ( taken on its own and out of context ) gives a very incomplete account of the mechanism of natural selection . The reason is that it does not mention a key requirement for natural selection , namely the requirement of heritability . It is true that the phrase `` survival of the fittest '' , in and by itself , is a tautology if fitness is defined by survival and reproduction . Natural selection is the portion of variation in reproductive success that is caused by heritable characters ( see the article on natural selection ) . </P>","<P> While the phrase `` survival of the fittest '' is often used to refer to `` natural selection '' , it is avoided by modern biologists , because the phrase can be misleading . For example , `` survival '' is only one aspect of selection , and not always the most important . Another problem is that the word `` fit '' is frequently confused with a state of physical fitness . In the evolutionary meaning `` fitness '' is the rate of reproductive output among a class of genetic variants . </P>","<P> Natural selection is commonly equated with survival of the fittest , but this expression originated in Herbert Spencer 's Principles of Biology in 1864 , five years after Charles Darwin published his original works . Survival of the fittest describes the process of natural selection incorrectly , because natural selection is not only about survival and it is not always the fittest that survives . </P>","<P> For Darwin and his contemporaries , natural selection was in essence synonymous with evolution by natural selection . After the publication of On the Origin of Species , educated people generally accepted that evolution had occurred in some form . However , natural selection remained controversial as a mechanism , partly because it was perceived to be too weak to explain the range of observed characteristics of living organisms , and partly because even supporters of evolution balked at its `` unguided '' and non-progressive nature , a response that has been characterised as the single most significant impediment to the idea 's acceptance . However , some thinkers enthusiastically embraced natural selection ; after reading Darwin , Herbert Spencer introduced the phrase survival of the fittest , which became a popular summary of the theory . The fifth edition of On the Origin of Species published in 1869 included Spencer 's phrase as an alternative to natural selection , with credit given : `` But the expression often used by Mr. Herbert Spencer of the Survival of the Fittest is more accurate , and is sometimes equally convenient . '' Although the phrase is still often used by non-biologists , modern biologists avoid it because it is tautological if `` fittest '' is read to mean `` functionally superior '' and is applied to individuals rather than considered as an averaged quantity over populations . </P>"]}
